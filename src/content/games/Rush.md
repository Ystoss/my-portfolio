Rush is a puzzle game built around two phases: first, the player places tiles in the level to redirect the cubes, then they test their solution. The entire game relies on a precise tick-based rhythm.

I created all the assets and the universe for this game, which takes place in a futuristic fruit juice factory.

This project, my first 3D game made with Unity, taught me a lot:

- Implementation of a precise tick-based gameplay system and interactions.

- Learning how to structure code using proper dependency management.

- Use of 3D mathematics for camera movements.

- Creation of 3D assets using Blender.

- Level design of two original levels.

For the game feel, I wanted to combine organic effects for the fruit with mechanical ones to emphasize the factory aspect of the game, all within a cartoon-style presentation featuring heavy squash and stretch and exaggerated animations.
