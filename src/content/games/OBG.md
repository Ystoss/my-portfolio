I designed a mobile serious game aimed at teaching the fundamentals of game feel through direct player experimentation with one major constraint : the game uses only one button : the whole screen.

The gameplay loop is pretty simple : for each ability the character have, the game will pause and the Player will have to choose between different variations of a visual juiciness effect. By letting the player actively choose between different visual feedback options, the game turns game feel into an explicit learning mechanic.

<h3> During this game I focused on and learned : </h3>

- Camera movements and transitions

- Implementation of a smooth and satisfying UI

- Implementation of many juiciness effects to chose from

- Game Design of the whole game
